Tetris (Ohjelmointi 2: Perusteet / Programming 2: Basics ; Kev√§t/Spring 2020)

The following program consists of game called "Tetris" where blocks called tetrominos fall downward one at a time and the player must connect them in a line in order to remove them.
When a tetromino hits the bottom or another tetromino if freezes in place and another one is dropped.
There exists 7 different tetrominos. Game shows the player which tetromino is about to fall next.
Game ends when the height of the fallen tetrominos reaches the top when this happens the player is informed with "Game over"-text and movement inputs can no longer be made.
Game keeps track of the played time per session and also updates score whenever the player successfully removes full lines.
Game can be paused with the "pause"-button and resumed with the "start"-button.
Scores are calculated as such:

1 line = +100 points
2 lines = +300 points
3 lines = +500 points
4 lines = +800 points

Whenever the player reaches the point where the amount of removed lines total is divisible by ten, the level rises by one and the game gets harder to a limit of six.

Player can move the falling tetromino by pressing the "A", "S" and "D" buttons on keyboard.
A - Left
S - Down (Makes the tetromino fall faster towards the bottom)
D - Right

Rotation (90 degrees) happens with "Q" and "E" buttons on keyboard.
Q - Counter-Clockwise
E - Clockwise

Player can store a tetromino as a "held tetromino" by pressing the "W" button on keyboard. It cannot be released back into the play area until the switched one has hit the bottom.
